# What this repository changed in the vendored upstreams

One section per change. This file is the record Apache-2.0 asks for, which is
that changed files are marked as changed, and it is what a reviewer reads
instead of a 389 file diff. The patch series beside it is generated from the
tree by `scripts/vendor-diff.ps1`; this is the part a script cannot write.

How to add one: [`README.md`](README.md).

Verify that this file describes the tree:

```bash
pwsh -NoProfile -File scripts/vendor-diff.ps1 -Check

## librqbit-dualstack-sockets: the Windows `new_from_name` ignores its argument

```
Unblocks:    nothing, and that is why it is first
Files:       vendor/librqbit-dualstack-sockets/src/bind_device.rs
             patches/librqbit-dualstack-sockets/0001-src-bind_device.rs.patch
Upstream:    not offered yet, and it should be
Added:       2026-08-22T12:24Z
```

`BindDevice::new_from_name` has two bodies. The `#[cfg(not(windows))]` one
resolves the interface name to an index. The `#[cfg(windows)]` one returns
`Error::BindDeviceNotSupported` without looking at its argument, and takes that
argument as `name`, so rustc's `unused_variables` fires on every Windows build.
The parameter is now `_name`, which is the whole change: the signature, the
behaviour and the public API are identical.

**Why it has to be here.** Because this repository ships the crate. Cargo passes
`--cap-lints allow` to a dependency it resolved from a registry and does **not**
pass it to a path dependency, so `[patch.crates-io]` made every warning in the
vendored trees ours. Under CI's `RUSTFLAGS: -D warnings` this one failed four
Windows jobs on the vendoring commit.

Dropping `-D warnings` was tried first and reverted on the operator's
instruction, and the reason is worth keeping: development happens on Windows,
so CI is the only place a warning on another platform is ever seen. A build that
does not fail on one cannot catch sloppy work. The cost of that decision is
exactly this file.

**How it was proved.** The build is clean with the flag on, where before it was
not:

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-D warnings" cargo build --workspace --all-features
```

**Offer it upstream.** It is a one-word fix to a real lint in their code, with
no behaviour attached, which is the easiest kind of change for a maintainer to
take. Until it is offered, this section says so rather than claiming otherwise.

## The template

Copy this for the next change.

```
## <upstream>: <what it is>

Unblocks:    T-NNN, and the line in TODO/<file>.md that names the seam
Files:       vendor/<upstream>/<path>, and the patch that carries it
Upstream:    not offered | offered, <url> | landed in <ref>, delete this
Added:       <ISO 8601 UTC>

What it does, in a paragraph a reviewer can check against the diff.

Why it cannot be done outside the vendored tree. This is the part that dates
fastest: a seam that was private may become public, and then the patch should
go rather than stay.

How it was measured, or which test holds it.
```

Three things that section must always answer, because each has already cost
somebody a session in this repository:

- **Which entry.** A vendored change with no `TODO/` entry behind it cannot be
  reviewed against anything, and it is the first thing a reconciliation has to
  weigh when upstream touches the same lines. The one above has none, and says
  so: it exists because of a build flag, not because of a defect in `bit-cli`.
- **Whether it is offered upstream.** A change shaped for upstream and a change
  shaped for this repository are different changes. Deciding which one it is
  afterwards means writing it twice.
- **Why it has to be here.** `TODO/RULES.md` section 5 has a rule about a doc
  describing a state the tree is not in, and a patch justified by a seam that
  has since opened is exactly that.
